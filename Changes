Revision history for App-tracepm

0.06     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.


0.05    2014-07-02 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - [Bugfix] scripts/ or bin/ files need to have something like #!perl and
          not #!/usr/bin/env perl so it can be replaced to the path of perl when
          installing [RT#96884]


0.04    2014-04-11 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add methods: prereqscanner{,_lite}{,_recurse}.


0.03    2014-04-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add field 'by' for method 'require', to see which package loads which
          module.

        - Remove field 'seq' for method 'fatpacker' since fatpacker tracer dumps
          %INC keys which are unordered.


0.02    2014-04-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add trace method: require.


0.01    2014-04-08 (SHARYANTO)
